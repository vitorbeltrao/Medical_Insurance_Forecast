## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run this notebook, you must install the [Category Enconders](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/).

```
!pip install category_encoders
```

Taking this, there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using insurance dataset to predict the medical insurance. Also, my other motivation was to show you an end-to-end Data Science project.

Soon, I will be putting here a file with the deployment of this model!

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to this project and the dataset.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://pandascouple.medium.com/projeto-de-machine-learning-previs%C3%A3o-de-pre%C3%A7o-de-seguro-m%C3%A9dico-uma-abordagem-bem-completa-396feacc5c55).
